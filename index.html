      <h2>Computer Engineering</h2>
      <p>Computer engineering (CoE or CpE) is a branch of electrical engineering and computer science that integrates several fields of computer science and electronic engineering required to develop computer hardware and software.[1] Computer engineers not only require training in electronic engineering, software design, and hardware-software integration, but also in software engineering.

      <h2>mechanical Engineering</h2>
        <p>mechanical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering from design to manufacturing to the marketplace for any object. Mechanical engineers analyze their work using the principles of motion, energy, and forceâ€”ensuring that designs function safely, efficiently, and reliably, all at a competitive cost.

      <h2>Civil Engineering</h2>
      <p>
Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering,[3] and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering. Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies.[5]
